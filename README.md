# DevOps World

Welcome to **DevOps World**, a simple Python application designed to be tested and deployed through a complete **DevOps workflow**. This repository focuses on the application, including setup, dependencies, and basic usage.

---

## Overview
This repository contains a simple Python application that will be integrated into a larger DevOps stack, but it **only includes the application itself**â€”not infrastructure, security, or monitoring configurations. Those components are managed separately in their respective repositories:

- **DevOps Infrastructure:** [`devops-infra`](https://github.com/ITByteEnthusiast/devops-infra/blob/main/README.md)  
- **DevOps Security:** [`devops-security`](https://github.com/ITByteEnthusiast/devops-security/blob/main/README.md)  
- **DevOps Monitoring:** [`devops-monitoring`](https://github.com/ITByteEnthusiast/devops-monitoring/blob/main/README.md)  

For details on cloud deployment, CI/CD pipelines, security scanning, and monitoring setup, refer to the above repositories.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- Visual Studio Code (or any IDE that supports the latest version of Python)
- Python (latest version recommended)
- pip (for dependency management)  
- Git (to clone the repository)  

### Installation

#### 1. Clone repo

Clone the repository and move into the project directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/devops-world.git
cd devops-world
```

#### 2. Install Python (If Not Installed)

- **Windows:**
  1. Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
  2. Run the installer and **check the box to add Python to PATH**.
  3. Verify installation:
     ```powershell
     python --version
     ```
    
- **Mac/Linux:**
  1. Install Python via your package manager:
     ```bash
     brew install python  # macOS
     sudo apt install python3  # Debian/Ubuntu
     ```
  2. Verify installation:
     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```

#### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

- **Windows:**
  ```powershell
  python -m venv venv
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
> If `python` doesn't work, try `py -m venv venv`.

- **Mac/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

â–  _You'll know it's activated when you see_ `(venv)` _in your terminal._

#### 4. Install Dependencies

Install all required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** All required Python packages (including Flask) will be installed automatically from `requirements.txt`. You do not need to install them individually.

---
## Run the Application

Start the Flask app with:

```bash
python app.py
```
> If `python` doesn't work, try `python3 app.py`.

Now, open your browser and navigate to **http://127.0.0.1:5000/** to see the running app.

To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

_Tip: You can use the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code for all commands above._

## Next Step

Now that your application repository is set up, it's time to review the overall security setup. Head over to the [README](https://github.com/ITByteEnthusiast/devops-security/blob/main/README.md) in the **devops-security** repository for an overview of key security practices used in this project.
