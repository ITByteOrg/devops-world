### **DevOps World â€“ README**  

Welcome to **DevOps World**, a simple "Hello World" Python application designed to be tested and deployed through a complete **DevOps workflow**. This repository focuses on the application itself, including setup, dependencies, and basic usage.

---

## **Overview**  
This repository contains a basic Python application that will be integrated into a larger DevOps stack, but it **only includes the application itself**â€”not infrastructure, security, or monitoring configurations. Those components are managed separately in their respective repositories:

- **DevOps Infrastructure:** [`devops-infra`](../devops-infra/README.md)  
- **DevOps Security:** [`devops-security`](../devops-security/README.md)  
- **DevOps Monitoring:** [`devops-monitoring`](../devops-monitoring/README.md)  

For details on cloud deployment, CI/CD pipelines, security scanning, and monitoring setup, refer to the above repositories.
